      <p class="description">Hey there! I'm a passionate web developer with a versatile skill set, specializing primarily in full-stack development. I possess a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end development and am constantly refining my abilities while seeking opportunities for growth in both domains.
        Currently, I am actively seeking full-stack opportunities that encompass both front-end and back-end development. If you're interested, I'd be thrilled to connect and discuss potential collaborations. I am currently working on several projects that emphasize specific tech stacks and frameworks, allowing me to further enhance my expertise.
        In my personal life, I enjoy collecting various figures, spending time watching shows, and creating UI/UX designs, and working out.
        Feel free to reach out if you would like to explore the potential of working together!</p>
