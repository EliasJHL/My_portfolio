        Hey there! Currently a first-year student at Epitech, I'm passionate about web development, cloud computing, and software development. I've already built a solid foundation, working on personal projects like Discord bots and games on Unity. My curiosity has led me to explore technologies such as Unreal, Unity, Roblox Studio, Godot, and CSFML.

        I'm seeking opportunities to enhance my skills as a full-stack developer. Engaged in projects that highlight specific technologies, I'm open to interesting collaborations. Outside of coding, I enjoy collecting figurines, watching shows, and crafting UI/UX designs. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in exploring potential collaborations!</p>
